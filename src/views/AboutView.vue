    <h1>Coding challenge</h1>
    <h3>Property Listings Management Dashboard</h3>
    <h6>Objective:</h6>
    <p>
      Develop a Property Listings Management Dashboard for a real estate CRM using Vue 3,
      TypeScript, TailwindCSS, and Pinia. The dashboard will allow users to add, view, edit, and
      delete property listings. Each listing should include details such as the property address,
      price, description, and status (e.g., Available, Sold, Under Contract).
    </p>
    <h6>Requirements:</h6>
    <p>
      - <strong> Frontend Technology:</strong> The application must utilize Vue 3 with the
      Composition API, be written in TypeScript, styled with TailwindCSS, and use Pinia for state
      management. Mock API/Data: Simulate data fetching and operations (CRUD) using a mock API setup
      or static JSON files. Include at least 5 initial property listings in your mock data. Core
      Features: Listings Display: Show all property listings in a responsive table or grid layout.
      Add/Edit Listing: Implement forms to add new listings and edit existing ones. Use modal
      dialogs or dedicated routes/pages. Delete Listing: Allow users to delete listings with a
      confirmation prompt. Filter/Sort Options: Include options to filter listings by status and
      sort by price. Responsiveness: The dashboard must be responsive and work well on both desktop
      and mobile devices. State Management: Use Pinia stores to manage the application's state,
      including the listings data and any UI state necessary for the task.
    </p>
    <h6>Bonus Challenges:</h6>
    <p>
      1. Search Functionality: Implement a search bar to filter listings by keywords in the address
      or description. 2. Pagination: Add pagination to the listings display if there are more than
      10 listings. 3. Testing: Write unit tests for your components and Pinia store(s) using Vue
      Test Utils and Jest or any other testing library compatible with Vue 3.
    </p>
    <h6>Deliverables:</h6>
    <p>
      - Source code for the Vue 3 application, properly organized and commented. - A README file
      that includes: Setup instructions (e.g., installation of dependencies, running the
      application). A brief explanation of the application architecture and component structure. Any
      assumptions made or additional features implemented beyond the core requirements.
